THe majority of what I used for this was taken from class notes, slides, and lecture, but I will give credit to W3 Schools, CSSTricks, & WikiHow.

Shout out to my fellow team member, Richard Wang, for helping me work out my FLexbox issue. 

It's been a long two weeks, but I'm starting to come along on all of this, thouh I know this isn't a perfect homework, I feel much more at ease with this course so far just from what I did with this project. Enjoy.
