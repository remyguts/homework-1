                        I was born in 1978, I grew up in a small town in Central New York. I've been creating since I
                        was 15.
                        My name is Remy Guts and I'm a multi platform artist. From painting, to design, and music, I
                        have imagined and created in many formats and arenas. I work in graphic design, paint,
                        illustration, and concept.
                        My interests include rock n roll, coffee, conversation, and nature.
